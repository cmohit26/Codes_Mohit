
What Are Assertions in JUnit?

	-> Assertions are statements that check expected vs actual results in a test.
	-> They help you verify that your code works as intended.
	-> If the assertion fails, the test fails. If all assertions pass, the test passes.



Steps to Do It

	Step 1 -> Create a test class â€” name it something like AssertionsTest.
	Step 2 -> Use the @Test annotation to mark test methods.
	Step 3 -> Use assertion methods like assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, etc.
	Step 4 -> Run the test in your IDE or with a build tool (like Maven or Gradle).
