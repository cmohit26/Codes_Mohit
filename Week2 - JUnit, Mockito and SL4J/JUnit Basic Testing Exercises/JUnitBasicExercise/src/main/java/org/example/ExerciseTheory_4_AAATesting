A-A-A for Junit-4

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A-A-A Explained

	A-A-A: Arrange-Act-Assert is a Testing Pattern

	1. Arrange
		Prepare the environment and inputs:
			Create objects.
			Set up necessary data.
			Configure dependencies.

	2. Act
		Perform the action you want to test:
			Call the method or functionality you are testing.

	3. Assert
		Verify the result:
			Use assertions to check that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

2. @Before and @After in JUnit4

	@Before: Marks a method that should run before each test method.
		-> Used to set up test fixtures (e.g., creating objects, opening resources).

	@After: Marks a method that should run after each test method.
		-> Used to clean up after tests (e.g., nullifying objects, closing resources).

3. Why A-A-A in JUnit4

	The AAA pattern isn't required by JUnit, but it's a best practice that helps make tests readable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

4. Benefits:
	Reuse test object setup.
	Avoid duplicating code in every test.
	Make tests easier to read and maintain.
